    "- **Root**: The top node in a tree.\n",
    "- **Parent**: A node that has one or more child nodes.\n",
    "- **Child**: A node that has a parent node.\n",
    "- **Leaf**: A node that has no children.\n",
    "- **Height**: The number of edges on the longest path between the root and a leaf.\n",
    "    - Height of an empty tree is -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complete Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.\n",
    "- **Perfect Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth.\n",
    "- **Balanced Binary Tree**: A binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.\n",
